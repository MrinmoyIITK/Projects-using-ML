# Projects-using-ML
This repository contains projects that I have done using ML
The project is based on heart disease prediction where using differnt Machine Learning Algorithims I  have tried to find out the best algorithim which does a good job in classifying patients with heart disease.
Also there is another project called the binary classification app the user can upload a data in csv file and then he will be given an option to chooose the appropriate train test split.
Then the user will get option to choose between range of algorithims like and also diferent performance metrics like precision,recall,F1 score will be displayed .
Then certainly the user will get an idea about which algorithim is working fine and he/she will get an option of implement where the data will be implemented on the whole datset.
Then the user can upload test set to test the model on unseen data.
